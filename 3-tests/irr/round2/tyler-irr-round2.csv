AIAAIC1844,26 US Members of Congress attacked using porn deepfakes,Agreement,"What happened

Over 35,000 instances of nonconsensual intimate imagery (NCII) involving 26 unnamed lawmakers were discovered on deepfake platforms by The American Sunlight Project.

Of those affected, 25 were women, highlighting a significant gender disparity in the victims of this technology.

Most of these images were removed after the researchers alerted the lawmakers' offices, but concerns remain about the potential for re-uploading and distribution of the content.

Why it happened

The rise in deepfake pornography is attributed to advancements in AI technology, which has made it increasingly easy to create realistic nonconsensual content in seconds.

The study found that younger members of Congress were disproportionately targeted and concluded that female lawmakers were 70 times more likely to be victims compared to their male counterparts.

The lack of comprehensive regulations around deepfakes exacerbates the issue, allowing perpetrators to exploit the technology with minimal repercussions.

What it means

The situation poses serious implications for women in politics and public life, potentially discouraging their participation due to fears of harassment and reputational damage.

Experts like researcher and writer Nina Jankowicz emphasise that the phenomenon sends a chilling message to women about the consequences of raising their voices in public forums.",2024,USA,Politics,,,Image,Non-consensual sexual media,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Politician,Unknown,Proprietary,Unknown,"Reputational harm, Psychological harm",Unknown,"Content removal, Media investigation",Actual,Website,Public,Low,Rudimentary
AIAAIC1532,50 Melbourne school girls targeted using AI nude images,Identifiable individuals,"Fifty female students at Bacchus Marsh Grammar school in Melbourne, Australia, were targeted with AI-generated fake nude images.

The images which were shared on social media, appeared to have been created using AI to graft photos of the girls' faces obtained from their private social media accounts onto others' bodies.

The mother of one of the targeted students shared that her 16-year-old daughter vomited after seeing the ""incredibly graphic"" and ""mutilated"" images online. The school said it was working with police to remove the images from social media and determine if the perpetrator is a student or someone else.

A teenage male was subsequently arrested in relation to the incident and released pending further inquiries.

The school said it was offering support to the affected students, who are in years 9 to 12 (approximately ages 14-18), and their families. The school's principal described the incident as ""appalling"" and stated that the girls should be able to learn without facing such ""nonsense"".

The incident drew widespread criticism, with many expressing concern over the safety and well-being of young girls in schools and online communities, and the lack of adequate regulation on non-consensual deepfake pornographic images in Australia.",2024,Australia,Education,Bacchus Marsh Grammar students,,Image,Non-consensual sexual media,Private individual - minor,Harass,"Sexual, Social",Yes,Individual,Private individual - minor,Private individual - minor,Unknown,Replacement,Psychological harm,Unknown,"Arrest, Content removal",Actual,Social media,Close,Low,Rudimentary

AIAAIC0455,AI influence campaign promotes Beijing interests in SE Asia,Fully synthetic persona,"Beijing ran an AI-powered network targeting Philippines, Southeast Asia and the US, prompting concerns about China's covert use of western social media platforms to promote its interests.

One network, which had links to people in Fujian province, China, primarily targeted the Philippines and South East Asian countries, and employed fake social media accounts to spread messages about China’s naval actions in the South China Sea, Hong Kong and in support of Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte.

It also posted content in support of or against presidential contenders Joe Biden, Donald Trump and Pete Buttigieg. The network apparently gained little traction in the US. Facebook took down 155 Facebook accounts, 11 Pages, nine Groups and six Instagram accounts affiliated with the network.

The second network originated in the Philippines and targeted users there with pro-Duterte content. 57 accounts, 31 Pages and 20 Instagram accounts were removed from Facebook.

AIAAIC1774,AI nudification bots swamp Telegram,Identifiable individuals,"What happened

A WIRED investigation discovered over 50 bots generating non-consensual fake nude images of women from regular photos, and drawing an estimated 4 million monthly users combined.

An earlier BalkanInsight (BIRN) investigation reported that tens of thousands of Telegram users in Serbia were sharing images of women ‘undressed’ by artificial intelligence. One such channel - for the ClothOff denudification app - had over 535,000 subscribers.

A February 2025 investigation by Nucleo found 23 Telegram bots actively creating AI-generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM), challenging the company's promises to crack down on such criminal content.

The victims often experience severe emotional distress, humiliation, fear and long-term psychological trauma due to the non-consensual nature of the images.

In some cases, the images are used to extort money.

Why it happened

Telegram's platform supports a multitude of channels and bots that facilitate the sharing and creation of these images, with users incentivised through gamification elements in which they earn rewards for creating and sharing deepfake images.

Telegram reportedly does little or nothing to stop these channels or their use.

Meantime, many legal jurisdictions lack specific regulations addressing altered images created by AI, leaving victims vulnerable to exploitation without legal recourse.

What it means

The findings raise significant concerns about the implications for privacy and the psychological well-being of victims, particularly young girls and women.

The situation underscores the urgent need for up-to-date legislation that addresses the unique challenges posed by AI-generated content.

While some initiatives have been proposed, such as the US Deepfake Accountability Act, most have not been signed into law and of those that have, questions about their effectiveness remain.",2024,Croatia; Kosovo; Montenegro; Serbia; USA,Personal,,"Alaiksandr Babichau, Alexander German, Dasha Babicheva, Yevhen Bondarenko",Image,Non-consensual sexual media,Sexual Exploiter,"Harass, Entertain","Sexual, Financial",Yes,Group,Any,Media users,Proprietary,Editing,"Harm to human rights and fundamental rights, Psychological harm, Economic or financial harm",Unknown,Media investigation,Actual,Social media,Anonymous,Low,Rudimentary

Fans and commentators reported it was difficult to distinguish between songs sung by Sun and her virtual version, and lamented her loss of copyright. By contrast, Sun, who had not released an album since 2017, responded primarily by lamenting AI's impact on jobs:

'Whether it is ChatGPT or AI or whatever name you want to call it, this ""thing"" is now capable of mimicking and/or conjuring, unique and complicated content by processing a gazillion chunks of information while piecing and putting together in a most coherent manner the task being asked at hand.

AIAAIC1350,AI-generated fake ID passes crypto exchange verification,Generic impersonation,"A service claiming to use AI neural networks to create fake ID documents has reportedly succeeded in passing Know Your Customer (KYC) checks on several crypto exchanges.

OnlyFake said it could instantly generate realistic fake identity documents such as driver’s licenses and passports from 26 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, the UK and multiple European Union countries for USD 15.

404 Media reported that it successfully bypassed the KYC verification of crypto exchange OKX using a photograph of a British passport one of its journalists generated with the site, where the ID appeared to be laid on a bedsheet as if a picture of it was taken.

AIAAIC1568,AI-generated Toys ‘R’ Us video ad sparks backlash,Identifiable individuals,"An AI-generated video advert released by Toys 'R' Us sparked controversy and a creative community backlash.

The one-minute video, created using OpenAI's new text-to-video tool Sora, depicts a young Charles Lazarus, the late founder of Toys 'R' Us, in his family's bike shop alongside the brand's mascot, Geoffrey the Giraffe.

However, the ad drew criticism for its numerous errors and inconsistencies, such as distorted character models, deformed toys, and unnatural movements. Critics also argued that using AI to create content targeting children is inappropriate and that young audiences deserve art crafted by human hands.

The ad also prompted advertising executives and others to voice fears that AI could potentially replace their human roles, and complained the ad was little more than a cynical attempt to cut costs at the expense of quality and artistic integrity.

Despite the backlash, Toys 'R' Us executives defended the ad, calling it ""successful"" and hinting at further integration of generative AI in their future strategies.",2024,USA,Consumer goods,,OpenAI,Video,,Private company,Entertain,Financial,No,Institution,Public figure,"Media users, Consumers",Proprietary,Reenactment,None,Unknown,Opprobrium,Actual,Advertisement,Public,Low,Rudimentary
AIAAIC1903,AI-manipulated video of Brazilian footballer Ronaldo scams online gamers,Agreement,"What happened

A deepfake video allegedly of Ronaldo appeared on Facebook encouraging users to earn more than their salary by downloading the popular online game Plinco (also known as ""Plinko"").

The video appeared to show Ronaldo speaking to camera in his own voice before showing AI-generated images of a schoolteacher, a bus driver and a grocery store worker.

However, the audio had been manipulated and the link provided led to a fake game called Bubble Shooter and likely resulted in people being defrauded.

A Faceboook user reported the content to Meta but the company did not remove it. The post was viewed approximately 600,000 times before finally being taken down.

Why it happened

The scam was made possible by the increasing sophistication and accessibility of software enabling anyone to create highly convincing deepfake videos quickly and at little or no cost.

The scammers likely targeted Ronaldo due to his fame and influence in order to lend credibility to their scheme.

Meta's initial failure to remove the content, despite user reports, is likely to have contributed to the scam's spread.",2024,Brazil,Media & Entertainment,,,Video,"Likeness Appropriation, Fraud",Scammers,"Influence, Deceive",Financial,Yes,Group,Public figure,"Media users, Fans",Unknown,Reenactment,Unknown,Economic or financial harm,Content removal,Actual,Social media,Public,High,Sophisticated
AIAAIC1771,Al account recovery scam calls target Gmail users,Generic impersonation,"What happened

According to security researcher Sam Mitrovic, who experienced it first hand, the scam begins with an unexpected notification asking users to approve a recovery request they had not initiated.

Following this, victims typically receive a phone call from someone posing as a Google support representative, using a convincing American accent and professional demeanour.

The American voice explained there had been some suspicious activity on Mitrovic's Google account and someone had accessed it a week ago. The apparent Google employee offered to send an email detailing what happened, and that message promptly arrived from an official Google address.

However, Mitrovic realised the voice was actually AI-manipulated or generated and hung up.

Why it happened

With nearly 2.5 billion users globally, Gmail is an appealing target for cybercriminals.

Scammers use sophisticated techniques, including AI-generated voices and spoofed email addresses, to create a sense of legitimacy. The use of AI enhances the realism of the calls, making it harder for victims to detect the fraud.

In addition, the scammers take advantage of common fears about account security, manipulating users into acting quickly without verifying the authenticity of the requests.

What it means

The rise of these types of scams indicates a trend in cybercrime where traditional phishing tactics are being augmented with advanced technology such as AI. This not only makes scams more convincing but also increases the risk for unsuspecting users who may not be equipped to identify these threats.

As these tactics evolve, it becomes crucial for users to remain vigilant and adopt protective measures, such as verifying unexpected recovery requests and regularly checking their account security settings.",2024,Global,Technology,,,Audio,,Scammers,Deceive,Financial,Yes,Group,Private individual - adult,Private individual - adult,Unknown,Editing,Economic or financial harm,Economic or financial harm,News report,Actual,Phone communication,Anonymous,High,Sophisticated

The fraudster made a video call to a businessman who was an existing contact on the individual’s WeChat app and told the businessman they needed to make a deposit during a bidding process.

The businessman subsequently transferred RMB 4.3 million to the fake friend’s bank account without verifying their true identity.

AIAAIC1431,Chinese voice actor sues AI companies for using her voice without consent,Identifiable individuals,"What happened

The voiceover artist, Yin, sued 5 companies, including the provider of the AI text-to-speech system and the company that had recorded her voice. The system in question uses generative artificial intelligence to recreate voices, allegedly with high precision.

This case is seen to venture into uncharted legal territory, where traditional copyright laws may not apply, thereby potentially setting a precedent for how individual likeness (e.g. “right to voice”) in the era of AI is perceived and protected..

Yin argued this represents a threat to her work and potential income, and added to concerns raised by voice actors globally over the future of their profession.

In April 2024, the court determined that the AI-generated voice was identifiable as Yin's due to its close resemblance in tone and style, thus infringing on her voice rights under Chinese law.

The defendants in the case were ordered to cease activities and pay compensation to the voice actor.

Why it happened

The case arose from Yin's discovery that her recordings, initially made for a media company, were used to train an AI system without her knowledge or consent.

The defendants argued that they had legally obtained the recordings and that the AI-generated voice was sufficiently distinct from Yin's original voice.

However, the court found that the AI's output closely matched Yin's vocal characteristics, leading to public association with her identity.

What it means

The ruling establishes a precedent for protecting individual voice rights in China, affirming that such rights extend to AI-generated voices when they can be associated with a specific individual.

The court ordered the defendants to cease using Yin's voice and to pay her RMB 250,000 (approximately USD 34,500) in damages.

The case emphasises the need for clear consent when using personal voices in AI applications and may prompt further legal developments regarding personality rights as technology continues to evolve.",2023,China,Media & Entertainment,,,Audio,Likeness Appropriation,Private company,Entertain,Financial,Yes,Institution,Public figure,"Media users, Fans",Proprietary,Reenactment,"Economic or financial harm, Harm to human rights and fundamental rights",None,"Lawsuit, Loss recovery",Actual,Television,Close,High,Sophisticated

According to 404 Media, while CivitAI does enforce its policy and remove offending content, non-consensual sexual imagery is still posted to the site 'regularly', some of which stays on the platform 'for months'.

AIAAIC1784,Company uses Marques Brownlee AI voice clone to promote product without consent,Agreement,"What happened

Networking product company Dot used an AI-generated clone of Brownlee's voice to promote their Dot Metal product in an Instagram ad.

Brownlee publicly called out the unauthorised use of his voice on social media, describing the company's actions as ""scummy"" and ""shady"".

Why it happened

The increasing accessibility and sophistication of AI voice cloning technology means that, with just a 15-second sample, some AI models can now generate convincing voice clones in minutes.

With thousands of hours of their voice available online, this technology presents a major risk to high-profile individuals like Brownlee, and to employers and others.

In this instance, Dot appears to have attemped to exploit the availability of AI voice cloning technology to capitalise on Brownlee's influence and credibility.

What it means

The incident highlights the extent to which the misuse of AI technologies jeopardises individuals and companies, and raises questions about the ethics and legality of using someone's voice or other likeness without their permission.

It also undercores the need for better safeguards and policies to protect individuals from unauthorised AI-generated replicas.

AIAAIC0154,"Deepfake Barack Obama calls Donald Trump ""a total and complete dipshit""",Agreement,"What happened

The fabricated clip showed a seemingly authentic Obama delivering uncharacteristically inflammatory remarks, including references to the film Black Panther and direct insults toward Trump.

While the video’s creators filmmaker Jordan Peele and BuzzFeed explicitly framed it as a warning about disinformation risks, its realistic execution caused initial confusion among viewers.

Why it happened

Peele’s project aimed to preemptively expose how deepfakes could be weaponised, particularly in political contexts.

The video emerged amid growing concerns about AI tools being used for nonconsensual pornography (96 percent of early deepfakes targeted women) and electoral interference.

Experts noted that while this specific deepfake used “primitive” techniques by modern standards, it foreshadowed more sophisticated manipulations requiring less source material.

What it means

The incident underscored vulnerabilities in media literacy and the risks of AI-driven disinformation campaigns. For society, it signaled a paradigm shift where “seeing is no longer believing,” complicating efforts to discern truth in digital content.

An AI-generated audio clip contained distorted claims about Musk ""making us look bad"" and ""cosplaying as this great American leader"".

Shared initially by Bishop Talbert Swan without disclaimers about its authenticity, the clip prompted Vance to threaten legal action for defamation if unretracted.

The fabrication emerged amid existing public scrutiny of Musk's political influence through his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

AIAAIC1617,Deepfake Kamala Harris slurs her lines,Agreement,"An AI-generated video apparently showing US Vice President Kamala Harris speaking incoherently and claiming she said things she never actually said prompted concerns about electoral disinformation and interference.

The 22-second clip purported to show Harris saying, “Today is today. And yesterday was today yesterday. Tomorrow will be today tomorrow. So live today so that future today will past today, as it is tomorrow.”

In reality, the video was created by combining audio from a parody circulating on TikTok with footage of a speech Harris gave on reproductive rights at Howard University in April 2023. The original footage and official White House transcript do not contain such remarks.

A watermark added to the text on the podium indicated the video was created by a pro-Donald Trump meme account whose tweet drew over 1.2 million views, according to AFP.

AIAAIC1215,Deepfake nudes target Winnipeg school female students,Agreement,"What happened

Doctored photos created using publicly accessible social media images of the students were altered using AI to produce highly explicit images and shared online, prompting students to report the incident to school officials.

Approximately 300 fake nude images were believed to have been created, affecting dozens of girls, many of whom were reported to have suffered serious emotional distress, feelings of violation, shame, fear of others, and anger.

Winnipeg police investigated the incident but laid no charges.

Why it happened

The incident was made possible due to the increasing accessibility and advancement of AI image generation tools, which have made it possible to produce highly realistic deepfakes with minimal effort.

Furthernore, some of these tools are expressly designed to facilitate this kind of behaviour, while others have few or no guardrails to limit how they can be used.

The perpetrators may have used one of these tools without fully understanding the gravity of their actions or the legal implications.

What it means

The incident highlights the growing challenge of protecting individuals, especially young girls, from abuse by people using AI.

It also underscores the need for fit-for-purpose legislation to address AI-generated explicit content, particularly involving minors, and improved digital literacy education in schools and amongst parents,",2023,Canada,Education,,,Image,Non-consensual sexual media,Private individual - minor,Harass,"Social, Sexual",No,Unknown,Private individual - minor,"Private individual - minor, Media users",Proprietary,Replacement,"Psychological harm, Harm to human rights and fundamental rights",Psychological harm,Criminal investigation,Actual,Social media,Close,Low,Rudimentary

The deepfake clip, which was taken down, appeared to order the “armed forces and special task groups” to act however they deem appropriate should China “attack” the Philippines.

Photographs of Chinese activities in the West Philippine Sea – including publicly released images from the Philippine Coast Guard – flashed in the video as a slideshow as the audio played.

AIAAIC1907,Deepfake Pierce Brosnan scam cripples art gallery,Agreement,"What happened

Simone Simms, the owner of SMS Art Gallery in Nottingham, spent months negotiating with what she believed to be Pierce Brosnan for an exclusive art exhibition. Brosnan is a keen painter.

The gallery advertised the event, selling tickets for up to GBP 500 for a meet-and-greet with the actor.

However, the real Pierce Brosnan denied any involvement with the exhibition and event, saying he would ""never charge for a meet and greet"" and that his attorney had sent a cease-and-desist letter to the gallery.

The exhibition and meet-and-greet were revealed to be a deepfake scam, leaving the gallery owner's livelihood and reputation in ruins.

Ms Simms refunded the GBP 20,000 of sold tickets but was forced to shut her gallery.

This scam began in the fall of 2019 when the victim ""M.M."" joined an online dating site around six months after her husband had passed away. Over several months, she developed a relationship with ""Buck"", who claimed to be stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Middle-east.

Buck then assured her he could help Ankeny but requested that she liquidate her accounts and wire the funds to a lawyer in New York, who would then send the money to Turkey. This manipulation led M.M. to send multiple payments to Buck totaling USD 287,928.
